# Cayley Graph Visualizer and Analyzer

This Python script provides tools to generate, visualize, and analyze Cayley graphs, particularly focusing on properties such as Hamiltonian cycles. Cayley graphs are useful in group theory for studying the structure and relationships of elements within a group. The script also allows you to visualize generator paths and verify the existence of Hamiltonian cycles.

## Features

1. **Cayley Graph Generation**: The function `cayley_graph(group, generators)` generates the Cayley graph for a given group and its generators.
2. **Graph Visualization with Colored Edges**: The function `draw_graph_with_colored_edges(G, edges_by_generator)` visualizes the Cayley graph using `matplotlib` and `networkx`, with edges colored according to their corresponding generators.
3. **Generator Path Representation**: The function `print_generator_paths_text(generators, group_size)` prints a textual representation of the paths generated by each generator.
4. **Hamiltonian Cycle Detection**: The function `has_hamiltonian_cycle(G)` checks if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in the given Cayley graph and displays the result.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib`
- `networkx`

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```sh
pip install matplotlib networkx
```

## Usage

1. **Define the Group and Generators**: Define a group as a list of elements and the corresponding generators. For example:

    ```python
    group = list(range(4))  # Group elements: 0, 1, 2, 3
    generators = [1, 2]  # Generators
    ```

2. **Generate the Cayley Graph**: Use the `cayley_graph(group, generators)` function to generate the graph representation.

3. **Visualize the Graph**: Call `draw_graph_with_colored_edges(G, edges_by_generator)` to draw the Cayley graph with different colors for each generator's edges.

4. **Print Generator Paths**: Use `print_generator_paths_text(generators, len(group))` to print the paths generated by each generator.

5. **Hamiltonian Cycle Detection**: Use `has_hamiltonian_cycle(G)` to check if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in the graph.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the script:

```python
# Define the group and generators
group = list(range(4))  # Group elements: 0, 1, 2, 3
generators = [1, 2]  # Generators

# Generate Cayley graph
G, edges_by_generator = cayley_graph(group, generators)

# Visualize Cayley graph with colored edges
draw_graph_with_colored_edges(G, edges_by_generator)

# Print generator paths
print_generator_paths_text(generators, len(group))

# Check for Hamiltonian cycle
has_hamiltonian_cycle(G)
```

## Output

- **Graph Visualization**: A circular graph with nodes and edges is drawn, with different colors representing different generators.
- **Generator Paths**: Textual representation of each generator's path through the group.
- **Hamiltonian Cycle Detection**: Prints whether a Hamiltonian cycle exists, along with the cycle itself if found.

## Notes

- This script currently works with additive groups modulo the size of the group. You can modify the group operations as needed for different types of groups.
- The Hamiltonian cycle detection is implemented using a backtracking algorithm, which may not be efficient for large groups.
